Hi my name is Petros Georgantzis and i am currently a student at Computer Science and Engineering department in the University of Ioannina, seeking an entry-level job opportunity. I have always been keen on Software Development and from my university i got experience in Machine Learning too, which i find very intresting like many other fields in computer science and engineering. Through my years in education, I have always practised my mathematical and programming skills so i can solve problems fast and efficiently. I have also been a 10+ years chess player, who played 3 times in whole Greece chess tournament after 2 qualifications to participate, which may considered as experience of deep thinking into problems. My approach to a problem is first to find the mathematical solution and then transfer the mathematical solution into programming. As a person i am both a team player but also an opportunist to propose desicions and solutions to problems. I am looking to gain experience and learn from it.
